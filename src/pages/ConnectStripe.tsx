            Give it <strong>read</strong> access to charges, balance, and payouts — nothing
            else. Copy the key (it starts with <strong>rk_live_</strong> or{' '}
            <strong>rk_test_</strong>) and paste it into the Stripe connector box. A health
            check runs immediately.

            After connecting, Stackduck shows you an <strong>endpoint URL</strong>. In Stripe,
            go to <strong>Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint</strong>, paste the URL, and
            listen to charge and payout events. Stripe hands you an endpoint{' '}
            <strong>signing secret</strong> (whsec_…) — paste it back into the connector and
            every event arrives verified within seconds. Skip this and you still get nightly
            revenue totals.

          Use a <strong>secret</strong> key (rk_/sk_), not the publishable one (pk_) —
          publishable keys can't read anything and fail immediately. Test-mode keys only
          see test data.

        <Trouble title="Connected, but no instant events">
          Totals land after the first nightly run. For instant events, the endpoint URL must
          be registered in your Stripe dashboard — pasting the key alone only enables polling.
