            Copy the <strong>Project URL</strong> (https://xyzcompany.supabase.co) and, under
            Project API keys, reveal and copy the <strong>service_role secret</strong> — not the
            anon public key next to it. Paste both into the Supabase connector box; the health
            check tells you on the spot if you grabbed the wrong key.

          <p>
            Service-role bypasses every row-level policy, so never commit it or paste it into
            a chat. If it was ever exposed, roll it under the same API settings page and
            reconnect with the fresh one. Error logs aren't covered — reading those needs a
            separate management token your project key can't provide.

          Polling runs about every 30 minutes — give it one full cycle. Active users count
